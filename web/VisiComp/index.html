        <h1>VisiComp</h1>
        <p>VisiComp is a programming environment inspired by a spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Spreadsheets are a great tool for simple calculations but they become cumbersome 
        when you are doing more complex calculations. The goal of VisiComp is to
        make these more complex calculations easier.</p>
